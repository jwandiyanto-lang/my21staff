## The 3 Pillars of the "Self-Driving Firm" MVP

### 1. The Foundation (Automatic Memory)
CRM builds itself. Bot listens to WhatsApp, populates CRM. Zero data entry.

### 2. The Autonomous Engine (WhatsApp Action)
Not just chat — moves the needle. Qualifies leads, asks for sale. 24/7 without supervision.

### 3. The Evolution (The Promotion System)
System tracks its own gaps. Every 90 days ($97) or 30 days ($297), generates a "Promotion":
*"I've learned enough to handle X now. Click here to promote me."*

**MVP Hook:** "Stop buying software that stays the same. Hire a Digital Firm that grows with you."

## Business Model Benefits

### Zero-Churn Logic
Canceling = "firing" a Senior Staff member and losing all progress.

### Upsell Bridge
When they see Phase 3 skills but realize they must wait 6 months:
- "Can I pay more to get that NOW?"
- Answer: "Upgrade to Pro ($297) for monthly upgrades instead of quarterly."

### Economic Benefit
Skills are pre-written System Prompts or API connections. Nearly zero labor to "promote" once library is built. Selling Progress with minimal manual work.
