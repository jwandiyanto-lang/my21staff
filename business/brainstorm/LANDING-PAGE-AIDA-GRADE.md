---

## AIDA Breakdown

### 1. ATTENTION — Grade: **D**

**What AIDA says:**
> "No system, no growth." — Stop the scroll. State the core truth.

**What the page has:**
- Badge: "WhatsApp CRM untuk UMKM" ❌ (feature, not pain)
- Headline: "Kelola Leads dari WhatsApp" ❌ (what it does, not why it matters)

**Problem:**
- Doesn't hit the pain point
- Doesn't state the core truth
- Visitor thinks "okay, another CRM" instead of "oh, that's MY problem"

**Should be:**
- Badge: "No system, no growth"
- Headline: "Leads everywhere. System nowhere." or "Gak ada sistem, gak bisa scale."

**Score:** 3/10

---

### 2. INTEREST — Grade: **B**

**What AIDA says:**
> "my21staff is the system — one dashboard for all your leads."

**What the page has:**
- Subhead: "CRM yang terhubung langsung ke WhatsApp & Meta Ads. Tangkap leads, kelola percakapan, dan tutup penjualan — semua dari satu dashboard." ✅ Good
- Features section: Database CRM, WhatsApp Messaging, Website & Webinar ✅ Clear

**What's missing:**
- Doesn't say "my21staff IS the system"
- Doesn't mention Facebook/Instagram (only WhatsApp)

**Score:** 7/10

---

### 3. DESIRE — Grade: **C**

- "Gratis Selamanya" label ✅

**What's missing:**
- ❌ No pricing shown (big miss!)

**Score:** 5/10

---

### 4. ACTION — Grade: **B-**

**What AIDA says:**
> "Get the system. Start growing." + friction reducers

**What the page has:**
- "Mulai Gratis" button ✅
- "Setup dalam 5 menit" ✅
- "Mulai Gratis Sekarang" final CTA ✅
- "Chat via WhatsApp" secondary CTA ✅

**What's missing:**
- ❌ CTA doesn't reinforce core message

**Score:** 6/10

## Summary Scorecard

| AIDA Stage | Grade | Score | Key Issue |
|------------|-------|-------|-----------|
| Attention | D | 3/10 | No pain point, no "no system no growth" |
| Interest | B | 7/10 | Good features, missing system positioning |
| Desire | C | 5/10 | No pricing, no social proof, no real photos |
| Action | B- | 6/10 | Good CTAs, doesn't reinforce message |
| **Overall** | **C+** | **5.3/10** | Needs core message + real imagery |

## Top 3 Fixes Needed

1. **Hero headline** → Change to pain-focused "No system, no growth"
2. **Add pricing section** → Show the UMR anchor
3. **Replace placeholders with real photos** → Show people using the system
