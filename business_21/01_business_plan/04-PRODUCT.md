## Human Team

We don't automate everything. Humans step in for:

| Situation | Why Humans? |
|-----------|-------------|
| Complex negotiations | Nuance, relationship, trust |
| High-value closing | Personal connection matters |
| Guardrail testing | During setup, ensuring AI behaves |
| Strategy decisions | Business context AI doesn't have |

## How It Works

```
Lead messages → The Intern (instant qualification)
                    ↓
            Is it a good fit?
                    ↓
            ┌───────┴───────┐
            ↓               ↓
        Qualifies      Not a fit
            ↓               ↓
    The Brain (if Pro)   Polite close
            ↓
    Human handover
            ↓
    Deal closes
```
