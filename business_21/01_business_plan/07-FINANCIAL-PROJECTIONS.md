## Honest Assessment

Year 1 is about:
1. **Proving the model** — Can AI actually close leads?
2. **Perfecting the handoff** — When does AI hand off to human?
3. **Finding product-market fit** — Which niche responds best?

If we hit 30-50 customers by year end, we're on track. If not, we iterate on the niche or pricing.
