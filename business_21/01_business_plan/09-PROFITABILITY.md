# Profitability Analysis

---

## Unit Economics (Per Client)

Let's look at what one Pro (Rp 4,500,000/mo) client actually costs you to maintain.

| Expense Item | Monthly Cost (Est.) | Notes |
|--------------|--------------------:|-------|
| Grok API (X.AI) | Rp 150,000 | Fast chat, high volume |
| Claude 3.5 API | Rp 250,000 | "Brain" tasks (Summaries/Marketing) |
| Kapso/Meta API | Rp 300,000 | Connection fees/per-conversation costs |
| Convex/Vercel/Misc | Rp 100,000 | Cloud hosting & database |
| **Total Monthly COGS** | **Rp 800,000** | |

**Gross Profit per Client:** Rp 4,500,000 - Rp 800,000 = **Rp 3,700,000**

**Profit Margin: 82%** (World-class for a service business)

## Year 1 Cash Flow Projection

The $750 (Rp 12M) Setup Fee saves your life. It pays for your time and marketing budget upfront.

### Quarter 1: The Foundation (1–5 Clients)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Setup Revenue | Rp 12M × 5 = Rp 60,000,000 |
| MRR (Avg) | Rp 15,000,000 |
| **Total Q1 Cash In** | **Rp 75,000,000** |

**Outcome:** Proven model + "seed money" to run ads.

### Quarter 2 & 3: The Ramp (5–30 Clients)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Setup Revenue | Rp 12M × 25 = Rp 300,000,000 |
| MRR (Avg) | Rp 90,000,000 |
| **Total Q2/Q3 Cash In** | **Rp 390,000,000** |

**Outcome:** Buy high-end gear + potentially hire part-time VA.

### Quarter 4: The Maturity (30–50 Clients)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Setup Revenue | Rp 12M × 20 = Rp 240,000,000 |
| MRR (Avg) | Rp 185,000,000 |
| **Total Q4 Cash In** | **Rp 425,000,000** |

## Year 1 Totals

| Metric | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| Total Revenue | ~Rp 890,000,000 |
| Total API/Tooling Costs | ~Rp 150,000,000 |
| **Net Profit (Before Tax/Owner Pay)** | **~Rp 740,000,000** |

## Worst Case Safety Net

If you hit **50% of targets (25 clients)**, you still have:

- **Rp 90M MRR** with almost zero overhead
- **82% margin** (same per-client economics)
- Still profitable, just slower growth

**That's the beauty of the "Faceless AI Staff" model — scales up easily, stays profitable even when small.**
