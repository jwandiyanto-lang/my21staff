## The Core Feeling

**"Drowning in the noise"**

Every Indonesian SME owner knows it: the anxiety of a notification-filled phone, the guilt of ignored leads, the burnout of being "always on."

## 6 Customer Emotional States

| # | Syndrome | Core Feeling | The Reality |
|---|----------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | **Whack-a-Mole Exhaustion** | Can't focus, phone always pinging | Every notification breaks flow state |
| 2 | **Leaky Bucket Guilt** | Paying for ignored leads | Leads paid for ads but no one followed up |
| 3 | **Unprofessional Shame** | Image doesn't match premium service | Late replies, typos, inconsistent follow-up |
| 4 | **Broken Record Syndrome** | Copy-pasting same answers | 50 variations of "Berapa harganya?" daily |
| 5 | **Tire-Kicker Resentment** | Wasting time on non-buyers | Hours spent on people who'll never convert |
| 6 | **Vacation Phobia** | Can't unplug, business dies without them | Haven't had a real break in years |
