# Mission, Vision & Values

---

## Mission

**Let our target market start scaling.**

We exist to help Indonesian SME owners break free from the "always on" trap. Our AI team handles the routine so humans can focus on what matters: closing deals, making decisions, and building a business that doesn't own them.

---

## Vision

**Focus on 1 year first — build the foundation, then expand.**

We believe in:
- Proving the model before scaling
- Deep expertise in one market before expanding to others
- Sustainable growth over hype

## Values

### Proactive (Not Reactive)

Our AI acts, not just responds. It reaches out, follows up, and moves deals forward. We don't wait for leads to go cold.

### Transparent Pricing

No hidden fees. No surprise charges. Clear value for clear price. You always know what you're paying for.

### Indonesian-First

We understand the Indonesian market deeply — WhatsApp culture, local business habits, and the unique challenges SMEs face. We're not a global tool adapted for Indonesia; we're built for Indonesia.

### Human + AI Hybrid

The best results come from humans and AI working together. AI handles the routine. Humans handle the complex. Each plays to their strengths.

## Founder Positioning (Anti-Hero)

We don't do the "guru" thing.

- **My background doesn't matter. What matters is the system.**
- **You don't have to be famous to be rich.**
- We're systems architects, not personal brands.

We're here to build something that works — not to sell you a dream.
