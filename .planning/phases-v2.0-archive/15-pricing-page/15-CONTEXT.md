# Phase 15: Pricing Page - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-16
**Status:** Ready for planning

<vision>
## How This Should Work

This isn't just a pricing page — it's the **closer**. The page tells a story that resonates with struggling business owners before revealing the solution (pricing).

**The Flow:**
1. **Header:** Same style as landing page. "Kembali" shows "21" logo, middle section empty.

2. **The Story (Empathetic Storytelling):**
   - Start with the real problem businesses face today
   - **Too many leads?** They're wasted — you're responding to everyone, not the right ones
   - **No leads?** You don't understand content and online advertising
   - **Nothing at all?** Maybe it's time to rethink the business
   - Big businesses succeed because they have **a system that works for them**

3. **The Pain Point (Rhetorical Question):**
   - "Pernah bulan ini ramai, tapi pas gajian atau pajak... uangnya kemana?"
   - Many businesses do well on the surface, but the money disappears when it's time to pay

4. **The Urgency:**
   - "No system = you're not growing, you're drowning in your problems"
   - "We don't have time for that, right?"

5. **The Filter (Before Pricing):**
   - "We don't accept everyone"
   - "We're not a plug-and-play CRM"
   - "We help you grow into a registered business ready to play in the big league"
   - This is for businesses **already feeling the pain** — they know something's broken

6. **Scroll to Pricing:**
   - Natural flow from story to "here's how we solve it"
   - Pricing details TBD (will discuss separately)

**Style:** Easy to follow, scannable. Big bold points for emphasis. Empathetic tone throughout — relatable, not preachy.

## What Must Be Nailed

- **Story comes first** — must resonate before showing prices
- **Exclusivity filter before pricing** — "not for everyone" sets the frame
- **Easy to read** — big bold statements, not walls of text
- **Empathetic tone** — "we've seen this, we understand" not "you're doing it wrong"
- **Natural scroll to pricing** — story builds momentum toward the solution

</essential>

## What's Out of Scope

- Pricing section details — will discuss separately
- Application/qualification form — CTA is scroll to pricing
- Complex animations — keep it clean and readable
- English version — Bahasa Indonesia primary

</boundaries>

## Specific Ideas

- Header: "kembali" → shows "21" (logo), middle section empty
- Match landing page design system (sage/orange, Plus Jakarta Sans + Inter)
- Rhetorical question format for the "money gone" pain point
- "Big league" / "registered business" language for aspiration
- Story structure: Problem → Why others succeed → Your pain → Urgency → Filter → Pricing

</specifics>

<notes>
## Additional Context

Target audience: Businesses **already feeling the pain** — drowning in leads they can't manage, or stuck with zero leads and no strategy. They know something's broken and are ready to invest in a real system.

The page positions my21staff as selective — not a tool you just sign up for, but a partnership for businesses serious about growth.
