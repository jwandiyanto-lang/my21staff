# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-30)

**Core value:** The system that lets you grow. Lead management, proposal organization, follow-up automation — all guided by someone who's been in business, not just developers selling software.

**Current focus:** Planning v2.0 (fresh feature approach)

## Current Position

Milestone: v2.0 (TBD — fresh start)
Phase: N/A (ready for planning)
Plan: N/A
Status: V1.0.0 archived, infrastructure preserved, features reset
Last activity: 2026-01-30 — Archived V1.0.0, prepared for V2.0

Progress: Clean slate for feature planning

**Location:** `.planning/archive/v1.0.0/`

**What was preserved:**
- Production infrastructure (Vercel + Convex + Clerk)
- Core integrations (Kapso WhatsApp API)
- Development patterns
- Codebase documentation (`.planning/codebase/`)

**What was reset:**
- All features (rebuilding from scratch)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

All current decisions are logged in `.planning/PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table.

- V1.0.0 → V2.0 reset (fresh feature approach, keep infrastructure)
- Archive Eagle workspace (deactivate first client)
- Keep Convex + Clerk + Vercel (infrastructure proven)
- Preserve codebase map (document current state)

### Pending Todos

None - ready for v2.0 planning.

### Blockers/Concerns

**For v2.0 planning:**
- Define fresh feature requirements
- Deactivate/archive Eagle workspace
- Plan new workspace approach
- Create v2.0 roadmap

## Next Steps

**Ready for v2.0:**

Use `/gsd:new-project` or `/gsd:new-milestone` to start fresh milestone with new feature approach.
