<objective>
Verify lead status updates work through the CRM workflow

Purpose: Confirm LEAD-03 requirement — Lead status updates work (new → qualified → consultation/community)
Output: Documented verification of complete status update flow

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify status update via admin mutation</name>
  <files>N/A (no files modified - verification only)</files>
  <action>
Use the Convex dashboard to manually update a test contact's status and verify it persists:

1. Open Convex Dashboard: https://dashboard.convex.dev
2. Select "intent-otter-212" deployment
3. Go to "Data" tab first to find the contact_id:
   - Click on "contacts" table
   - Find the contact named "Test Lead Phase5" (created in Plan 01)
   - Copy the _id field value (looks like: j57abc123...)
   - This is your contact_id for testing

4. Go to "Functions" tab
5. Find `contacts:updateContact` mutation

Run the mutation with the test contact:
```json
{
  "contactId": "<paste the _id from step 3>",
  "lead_status": "qualified"
}
```

Expected result:
- Mutation completes successfully
- Contact's lead_status field updates to "qualified"
- updated_at timestamp changes

Then verify in Data tab:
- Find the contact by ID
- Confirm lead_status is now "qualified"

Document the contact_id used and the result.
  </action>
  <verify>
Mutation returns successfully and contact's lead_status changes to "qualified" in database
  </verify>
  <done>
Status update from "new" to "qualified" works via direct mutation
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Test status workflow transitions</name>
  <files>N/A (no files modified - verification only)</files>
  <action>
Test the complete status workflow by updating the same contact through all relevant states:

1. Update to "consultation" status:
   - Use Convex dashboard Functions tab
   - Run `contacts:updateContact` with:
     ```json
     {
       "contactId": "<same contact_id from Task 1>",
       "lead_status": "consultation"
     }
     ```
   - Verify in Data tab: lead_status = "consultation"

2. For a different test contact, update to "community" status:
   - Go to Data tab, find another contact (e.g., "Local Format Test" from Plan 01)
   - Copy its _id
   - Run `contacts:updateContact` with:
     ```json
     {
       "contactId": "<different contact_id>",
       "lead_status": "community"
     }
     ```
   - Verify in Data tab: lead_status = "community"

3. Verify Brain's updateContactScore function signature:
   - Go to Functions tab
   - Find `ai/brain:updateContactScore` (internal mutation)
   - Note: This is the function called by analyzeConversation in the Bot Workflow
   - It accepts: contactId, leadScore (number), leadStatus (string)
   - It patches contacts table with lead_score, lead_status, and updated_at

Document all status transitions and their results.
  </action>
  <verify>
All status transitions (new → qualified → consultation/community) complete successfully
  </verify>
  <done>
Status workflow supports all required transitions: new, qualified, consultation, community
  </done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Lead status update verification</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open Contact Database:
   - Go to https://my21staff.com/eagle-overseas/database

2. Find the test contacts:
   - "Test Lead Phase5" (updated to "consultation" in Task 2)
   - "Local Format Test" (updated to "community" in Task 2)

3. Verify status displays correctly:
   - Check the Status column/badge in the contact list
   - "consultation" should show (possibly as "Consultation" or a hot/warm indicator)
   - "community" should show (possibly as "Community" or a nurture indicator)

4. Test status filter (if available):
   - Filter by status = "consultation"
   - Verify only contacts with that status appear
   - Filter by status = "community"
   - Verify only contacts with that status appear

5. Verify real bot workflow integration:
   - Check if any contacts have been updated by the Bot Workflow (Phase 4)
   - Look for contacts with lead_score > 0 and status != "new"
   - These would have been updated by Brain's updateContactScore during conversation

Optional - Simulate bot flow:
   - Send a WhatsApp message to the Eagle number
   - Go through qualification questions
   - Check if lead_status updates automatically
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if status updates display correctly, or describe any issues</resume-signal>
