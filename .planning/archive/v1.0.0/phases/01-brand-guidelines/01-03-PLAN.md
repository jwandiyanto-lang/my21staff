# Phase 1 Plan 03: Folder Restructure

**Goal:** Separate business knowledge from webapp code with clear folder structure

**Estimated Tasks:** 5

---

## Context

Current state has business docs scattered. Need clean separation:
- `business/` — Brand, brainstorm, bots, clients
- `src/`, `public/`, etc. — Webapp code
- `.planning/` — GSD workflow (stays separate)
- `CLAUDE.md` — Lightweight directory index at root

---

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create business folder structure
```
mkdir -p business/brainstorm
mkdir -p business/bots
mkdir -p business/clients
mkdir -p business/brand/scripts
mkdir -p business/brand/docs
```

**Commit:** `feat(business): create folder structure for business knowledge`

---

### Task 2: Move and merge files

Move script:
```
git mv scripts/generate-logos.js business/brand/scripts/
```

Merge docs into business/brand/docs:
```
git mv docs/BUSINESS-PLAN.md business/brand/docs/
git mv docs/ONE-PAGER.md business/brand/docs/
git mv docs/PRICING.md business/brand/docs/
git mv docs/STAFF.md business/brand/docs/
```

Note: `docs/BRAND.md` is duplicate of `business/brand/BRAND.md` — delete it:
```
rm docs/BRAND.md
rmdir docs
```

**Commit:** `refactor(business): move docs and scripts into business folder`

---

### Task 3: Create client template

Create `business/clients/eagle-overseas.md`:
```markdown
# Eagle Overseas Education

**Workspace ID:** 25de3c4e-b9ca-4aff-9639-b35668f0a48e
**Status:** First paying client (v2.1 target)

## Overview
Indonesian education consultant helping students study abroad.

## WhatsApp
- Bot persona: Kia (see business/bots/)
- Primary channel for lead communication

## Notes
[Quick reference notes here]
```

**Commit:** `docs(clients): add Eagle Overseas client reference`

---

### Task 4: Create bots placeholder

Create `business/bots/README.md`:
```markdown
# Bot Personas

Bot configurations and AI personas for WhatsApp automation.

## Personas

- `kia.md` — Eagle Overseas education consultant persona (Phase 9)

## Structure

Each persona file contains:
- Name, role, personality
- Response style guidelines
- Context about the client business
- Example interactions
```

**Commit:** `docs(bots): add bots folder with README`

---

### Task 5: Rewrite CLAUDE.md as directory index

Slim down CLAUDE.md to be a lightweight index:

```markdown
# my21staff

WhatsApp CRM + AI team for Indonesian SMEs.

## Folders

| Folder | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `business/` | Brand, brainstorm, bots, clients |
