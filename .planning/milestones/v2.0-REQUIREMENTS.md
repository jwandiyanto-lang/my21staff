## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Visual workflow builder | Use Kapso workflow UI, build custom later |
| WhatsApp template messages | Requires Meta approval process, use API for now |
| Self-service onboarding | Manual onboarding sufficient for v2.0 |
| Billing/subscriptions | Not needed yet — focus on core CRM |
| Multi-user chat assignment | Single user focus for v2.0 |
| Google Calendar integration | Defer to v2.1+ |
| Voice note transcription | Edge case, not core to CRM v2.0 |
| Document upload handling | Requires storage strategy, defer |
| Video call support | Outside CRM scope |
| WhatsApp Flows | Meta approval required, use workflows instead |
| Voice agent integration | Future consideration |
| Eagle workspace operations | Eagle is archived, new workspace only |
