  - phase: 02-production-deployment
    provides: Production verification report identifying UI issues
provides:
  - Fully internationalized English UI (Team and Settings pages)
  - Verified WhatsApp config hides internal API details
  - Verified Settings form fields are interactive
  - Verified Clerk provider uses current API (no deprecation warnings)

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Internationalization via hardcoded English strings (i18n library deferred)
    - Brand compliance: internal "Kapso" hidden from UI labels

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - src/app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/team/page.tsx
    - src/app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/settings/settings-client.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "Use hardcoded English strings instead of i18n library (simpler, adequate for current scope)"
  - "Keep Kapso as internal variable names, show Meta in UI (brand compliance)"
  - "Issues #13, #16, #21 verified as already fixed (no code changes needed)"

patterns-established:
  - UI text must be English (Indonesian text in code = bug)
  - Form field labels use English with IDR currency notation for Indonesian market
  - Internal tech names (Kapso) never shown to users

# Phase 2.1 Plan 06: UI Polish - Internationalization & Settings Summary

**Team and Settings pages fully internationalized to English, WhatsApp config verified to hide API option, form fields verified interactive, Clerk deprecation verified absent**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3m 52s
- **Started:** 2026-01-29T06:20:29Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-29T06:24:21Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 2

## Accomplishments
- Replaced all Indonesian text in Team page with English ("Anggota Tim" → "Team Members")
- Replaced all Indonesian text in Settings form field labels with English (Budget, Departure, English Level, Activity)
- Verified WhatsApp integration shows only Meta option (no API selection visible)
- Verified Settings form fields are fully interactive (value/onChange handlers present)
- Verified Clerk provider has no deprecated props (no afterSignInUrl/afterSignUpUrl)

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Fix Dashboard and Settings internationalization** - `82f7a8f` (fix)
   - Team page: "Anggota Tim" → "Team Members"
   - Settings Budget labels: "Juta/Miliar" → "Million/Billion IDR"
   - Settings Departure labels: "Bulan/Tahun" → "Months/Years"
   - Settings English Level: "Pemula/Menengah/Mahir" → "Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced"
   - Settings Activity: "Kuliah" → "Currently Studying"
   - Settings Budget: "Mencari Beasiswa" → "Looking for Scholarship"

2. **Task 2 & 3: Verify WhatsApp config, form fields, Clerk deprecation** - `9676233` (docs)
   - Issue #16: WhatsApp config verified - only Meta option visible
   - Issue #13: Form fields verified - all interactive with proper handlers
   - Issue #21: Clerk provider verified - no deprecated props

**Plan metadata:** (included in task commits)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/team/page.tsx` - Team Management page internationalized to English
- `src/app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/settings/settings-client.tsx` - Form field labels internationalized to English

## Decisions Made

**Internationalization approach:**
- Used hardcoded English strings instead of i18n library
- Rationale: Simpler implementation, adequate for current scope
- Future: Can refactor to i18n library if multi-language support needed

**Brand compliance:**
- Internal variable names use "Kapso" (backend tech)
- UI labels show "Meta" / "WhatsApp Business"
- Rationale: Follows brand guideline "Never mention Kapso to customers"

**Issues #13, #16, #21 already fixed:**
- Verification showed these issues were already correctly implemented
- No code changes required
- Documented findings in commit

## Deviations from Plan

**1. [Pre-resolved Issues] Issues #13, #16, #21 already fixed in codebase**
- **Found during:** Tasks 2 & 3 (verification phase)
- **Issue:** Plan expected to find and fix these issues, but they were already correctly implemented
- **Root cause:** Either false positives in verification report, or fixed manually/as side effects of other commits
- **Action taken:** Verified each issue thoroughly, documented findings, committed verification
- **Files verified:**
  - src/app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/settings/settings-client.tsx (WhatsApp config, form fields)
  - src/app/providers.tsx (Clerk deprecation)
- **Evidence:**
  - Issue #16: No radio/select for API vs Meta - UI shows only Meta fields
  - Issue #13: All Input fields have value={} and onChange={} props with proper handlers
  - Issue #21: No afterSignInUrl/afterSignUpUrl props in ClerkProvider
- **Committed in:** 9676233 (empty commit with documentation)

---

**Total deviations:** 1 (pre-resolved issues - no code changes needed)
**Impact on plan:** Zero scope change. Original plan goals (English UI, clean console, interactive forms) all achieved. Tasks 2 & 3 became verification-only instead of fix tasks.

## Issues Encountered

None - all tasks executed smoothly.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- UI fully internationalized to English (Issues #14, #15 resolved)
- WhatsApp config shows only Meta option (Issue #16 verified)
- Settings form fields interactive (Issue #13 verified)
- Clerk provider clean (Issue #21 verified)
- 5 medium-priority UI issues from verification report now resolved
- Ready for remaining Phase 2.1 plans (Plan 03, 07, 08)

**Blockers:** None

**Concerns:** None - all issues addressed or verified correct
