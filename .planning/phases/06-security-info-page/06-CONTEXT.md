# Phase 6: Security Info Page - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Static trust-building page for paying clients — explains data storage, user control, and contact options. Written in Bahasa Indonesia. This is a presentation/trust page, not a full FAQ system.

## Implementation Decisions

### Data Storage Communication
- Simple reassurance tone — no technical jargon
- All data categories mentioned: contacts, messages, team members, attachments
- Location: "Singapura — lokasi terdekat untuk kecepatan akses dari Indonesia"
- Emphasize data ownership: export and delete options available

### Page Sections
- Three sections: Data Storage, Data Control, Contact
- No FAQ accordion — just straightforward information blocks
- Data Storage: where data lives, what's stored, encryption (simple terms)
- Data Control: export capability, deletion rights
- Contact: WhatsApp button + email option for security questions

### Navigation
- Footer link only (not header)
- Discoverable but not prominent

### Claude's Discretion
- URL path (/keamanan vs /security) — based on codebase patterns
- Visual treatment (icons, spacing, illustrations)
- Exact copy and section headings
- WhatsApp pre-filled message text

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Purpose is presentation/trust-building for potential clients
- Keep it simple and reassuring, not comprehensive legal documentation

</specifics>

## Deferred Ideas

None — discussion stayed within phase scope
