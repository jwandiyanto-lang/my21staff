## Current Test

[testing complete]

## Tests

### 1. Your Team Navigation in Sidebar
expected: Sidebar shows "Your Team" with Users icon (not "Your Intern" with Bot icon). Clicking "Your Team" navigates to /[workspace]/your-team page.
result: pass

### 2. Intern and Brain Tabs
expected: Your Team page shows two tabs: "Intern" and "Brain". URL updates with ?tab=intern or ?tab=brain when switching tabs. Tabs are shareable via URL.
result: pass

### 3. Intern Tab Shows Existing Content
expected: Intern tab displays existing Persona/Flow/Database/Slots sub-tabs from old knowledge-base route, unchanged.
result: pass

### 4. Brain Tab Shows Placeholder
expected: Brain tab displays "Grok Manager Bot" heading with feature list (summary generation, lead scoring, analysis triggers).
result: pass

### 5. Knowledge Base Redirects
expected: Visiting /[workspace]/knowledge-base redirects to /[workspace]/your-team?tab=intern automatically.
result: pass

### 6. Bot Names Card in Settings
expected: Settings > Integrations tab shows "Bot Names" card after AI Assistant card. Displays two input fields: "Chat Bot Name" (default: Sarah) and "Manager Bot Name" (default: Grok).
result: pass

### 7. Bot Names Auto-Save
expected: Typing in bot name fields triggers auto-save. Toast notification appears saying "Bot names updated". Names persist after page refresh.
result: issue
reported: "in settings the name change but in your team is not changing"
severity: major

### 8. Intern Settings Component
expected: Your Team > Intern tab shows 4 configuration cards: Persona Settings, Behavior Rules, Response Settings, and Slot Extraction. Each card has multiple input fields with default values.
result: pass

### 9. Brain Settings Component
expected: Your Team > Brain tab shows 3 configuration cards: Summary Settings, Scoring Configuration, and Analysis Triggers. Scoring weights show validation warning if they don't total 100%.
result: issue
reported: "it doesnt show any warning, and lets not use scroll but just a fill in box"
severity: minor

### 10. Settings Auto-Save with Toast
expected: Changing any setting in Intern or Brain components triggers auto-save. Toast notification appears confirming save. Settings persist after page refresh (localStorage in dev mode).
result: pass

### 11. WhatsApp Inbox in Sidebar
expected: Sidebar shows "Inbox" under Operations section. Clicking opens /[workspace]/inbox page.
result: pass

### 12. Inbox Two-Panel Layout
expected: Inbox page shows two panels: left panel with conversation list (search bar + conversations), right panel with message view (bubbles + send input).
result: issue
reported: "just one panel"
severity: major

### 13. Inbox Dev Mode Indicator
expected: In dev mode (/demo), inbox shows "Offline Mode" indicator with orange dot. Mock conversations appear with Indonesian names (Budi, Siti, Ahmad).
result: pass

### 14. Inbox Geist Mono Font
expected: Phone numbers, timestamps, and message content in inbox use monospace Geist Mono font (not sans-serif).
result: pass

### 15. Inbox Branding Colors
expected: Inbox uses my21staff green (#22C55E) for primary actions and orange (#F97316) for accents. NOT WhatsApp green (#25D366).
result: pass

### 16. Message Sending (Dev Mode)
expected: Typing in message input and pressing send adds message to conversation optimistically. Message appears immediately with outbound styling.
result: skipped
reason: Cannot test - message view panel missing (blocked by test 12)

### 17. Settings Sync Status Indicator
expected: Settings page header shows sync status indicator. In dev mode, shows "Offline Mode" badge with orange dot. In production, shows green "Synced" / orange "Syncing" / red "Error" states.
result: pass

### 18. Settings Backup on Save
expected: Saving bot names, intern config, or brain config creates automatic backup. Backup succeeds even if network fails (non-blocking pattern).
result: pass

### 19. Dev Mode Works Offline
expected: All pages work at /demo without internet connection. No Convex/Clerk errors. Mock data displays correctly.
result: pass

### 20. Type Check Passes
expected: Running `npm run type-check` shows no TypeScript errors in inbox, settings, or your-team components.
result: issue
reported: "11 TypeScript errors found: settings-backup route params type, settings page prop names, SyncStatusIndicator prop types, convex client imports"
severity: major
