# 02_5-01-PLAN.md: Your Team Navigation & Layout

<objective>
Restructure navigation to replace "Your Intern" with "Your Team" containing sub-navigation for Intern (Sarah chat bot) and Brain (Grok manager bot). This establishes the foundation for bot configuration UI.
</objective>

<must_haves>
- Sidebar navigation shows "Your Team" instead of "Your Intern"
- Your Team page has sub-navigation for Intern and Brain tabs
- Intern tab contains existing knowledge-base content (Persona, Flow, Database, Slots)
- Brain tab has placeholder for Grok manager bot settings
- Route structure: /[workspace]/your-team with ?tab=intern or ?tab=brain
- Uses my21staff design system (black/white, Geist Mono)
- Dev mode works fully offline with mock data
</must_haves>

<tasks>

## Task 1: Update sidebar navigation

Replace "Your Intern" with "Your Team" in the workspace sidebar navigation.

Files modified:
- MODIFY: src/components/workspace/sidebar.tsx
  - Change nav item title from "Your Intern" to "Your Team"
  - Change href from "/knowledge-base" to "/your-team"
  - Keep Bot icon (or switch to Users icon for team)

Verification:
- [ ] Sidebar shows "Your Team" link
- [ ] Link navigates to /[workspace]/your-team

## Task 2: Create Your Team page structure

Create new Your Team page with tab navigation for Intern and Brain.

Files modified:
- CREATE: src/app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/your-team/page.tsx
  - Server component that fetches workspace data
  - Passes workspace to YourTeamClient
  - Handles dev mode with mock data

- CREATE: src/app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/your-team/your-team-client.tsx
  - Client component with Tabs for Intern/Brain
  - Uses URL param ?tab=intern|brain for tab state
  - Intern tab renders existing knowledge-base tabs (Persona, Flow, Database, Slots)
  - Brain tab shows placeholder "Grok Manager Bot - Coming Soon"
  - Uses Shadcn/ui Tabs component
  - Design matches existing my21staff style

Structure:
```
Your Team
├── [Intern] [Brain] (tab navigation)
│
└── Intern Tab:
    ├── [Persona] [Flow] [Database] [Slots] (sub-tabs)
    └── Existing knowledge-base content
│
└── Brain Tab:
    └── Placeholder: "Grok Manager Bot"
       - Summary generation settings
       - Lead scoring configuration
       - Analysis triggers
```

Verification:
- [ ] /[workspace]/your-team loads without errors
- [ ] Tab navigation shows Intern and Brain
- [ ] Clicking Intern shows existing persona/flow/database/slots tabs
- [ ] Clicking Brain shows placeholder content
- [ ] URL updates with ?tab=intern or ?tab=brain

## Task 3: Redirect old knowledge-base route

Add redirect from old /knowledge-base route to new /your-team route for backwards compatibility.

Files modified:
- MODIFY: src/app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/knowledge-base/page.tsx
  - Add redirect to /[workspace]/your-team?tab=intern
  - Use next/navigation redirect()

Verification:
- [ ] Navigating to /[workspace]/knowledge-base redirects to /[workspace]/your-team?tab=intern
- [ ] No 404 errors for old bookmarks

## Task 4: Verify dev mode functionality

Test that Your Team page works in dev mode (offline, mock data).

Files modified: None (testing only)

Verification:
- [ ] /demo/your-team loads without errors
- [ ] Tab navigation works
- [ ] Intern tab shows existing knowledge-base content
- [ ] No Convex/Clerk errors in console
- [ ] Brain tab shows placeholder

</tasks>
