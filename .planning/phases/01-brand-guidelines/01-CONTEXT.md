# Phase 1: Brand Guidelines - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-18
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Foundation for all visual work — create BRAND.md with logo rules, colors, typography, and voice guidelines. Generate actual logo PNG files.

## Implementation Decisions

### Logo Files
- Create both formats: full wordmark (my21staff) + icon only (21)
- Color variation: orange 21 on light backgrounds only (primary use case)
- Standard size set: 32px, 64px, 128px, 256px
- Location: `/business/brand/` folder (separate from webapp)

### Folder Structure
- Separate folders in this repo: `/business/` and `/webapp/`
- Brand assets go in `/business/brand/`
- This prepares for future separation while keeping single repo for now

### Color Palette
- Use existing landing page colors (matte orange + green)
- Keep current header styling as reference

### Claude's Discretion
- Typography system (weights, hierarchy, sizes)
- Plus Jakarta Sans vs Inter usage split
- Voice & tone specifics (somewhat formal for middle-class business audience)
- Exact color hex values (extract from landing page)
- Dark mode considerations
- Semantic colors (success, error, warning)
- BRAND.md structure and depth

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- "Keep what we have on landing page — I like that matte orange green color"
- "Hero font is good" (Plus Jakarta Sans)
- "Somewhat formal because targeting middle class business — not too formal"
- Current header styling is approved as reference
