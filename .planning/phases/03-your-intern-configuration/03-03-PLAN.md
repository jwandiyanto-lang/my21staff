<objective>
Fix harsh orange background color in AIToggle component. User reported the full-saturation accent orange (#F7931A) is too bright as a container background and hurts readability. Change to subtle accent/10 background to match existing design patterns in the component.

Purpose: Improve visual harmony and reduce eye strain from excessive orange saturation in admin UI
Output: AIToggle component with softer, more professional appearance
</objective>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Fix AIToggle background color opacity</name>
  <files>src/components/knowledge-base/ai-toggle.tsx</files>
  <action>
Change line 83 from `bg-accent` to `bg-accent/10`.

This matches:
- Line 76: `bg-accent/50` (skeleton loading state uses opacity variant)
- Line 87: `bg-green-500/10` (icon background uses opacity variant)
- Design pattern: Full-saturation colors only for icons/small UI elements, never large surfaces

The accent orange (#F7931A) is designed for CTAs and highlights. Large backgrounds should use reduced opacity (10%) for visual hierarchy and readability.

Reference existing code from 03-01-SUMMARY.md showing this is part of the already-implemented AIToggle component. No other changes needed - rest of component already uses correct opacity patterns.

  <verify>
1. Open src/components/knowledge-base/ai-toggle.tsx
2. Confirm line 83 now reads: `<div className="bg-accent/10 rounded-lg p-4">`
3. Build and run: `npm run dev`
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/demo/knowledge-base
5. Verify AIToggle appears with subtle orange background (not harsh full-saturation)
6. Verify icon/badge styling unchanged (still use appropriate colors)
  </verify>
  <done>
AIToggle background uses bg-accent/10 (10% opacity orange). No console errors. Component renders consistently with design system. User reports color is no longer harsh.
  </done>
</task>

Confirm:
- AIToggle component loads without errors at /demo/knowledge-base
- Background color is now subtle accent/10 (appears as light orange tint, not harsh full orange)
- Icon (green when enabled, gray when disabled) and status badge contrast properly with new background
- Styling matches existing opacity patterns in component (line 76, line 87)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Gap from UAT closed: Toggle background no longer harsh/orange
- Component maintains all functionality (toggle works, auto-save works, toast appears)
- No regression in styling, layout, or interaction behavior
- Visual appearance matches design system patterns (opacity modifiers on large surfaces)
</success_criteria>
