<objective>
Interactive localhost audit to identify all issues before fixing.

Purpose: The user must manually test /demo pages to discover broken flows, missing UI elements, console errors, and unhandled rejections. This creates the issue list that Plan 02 will fix.
Output: Documented list of issues found during testing (reported verbally via checkpoint).

  <name>Task 1: Start dev server and verify offline mode</name>
  <files>N/A (verification only)</files>
  <action>
1. Verify .env.local has `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true`
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server
3. Open http://localhost:3000/demo in browser
4. Confirm the footer shows "Offline Mode" (orange dot indicator)
5. Check browser console for any errors on initial load

  <what-built>The executor started the dev server and verified offline mode is active.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
**Walk through each /demo page and report issues:**

1. **Dashboard** (http://localhost:3000/demo)
   - Does it load without console errors?
   - Are stats cards showing mock data?
   - Is activity feed visible?

2. **Inbox** (http://localhost:3000/demo/inbox)
   - Does the conversation list load?
   - Can you click on a conversation?
   - Does the status filter dropdown work?
   - Is the AI/Human toggle visible and functional?

3. **Database** (http://localhost:3000/demo/database)
   - Does the contacts table load?
   - Can you view contact details?
   - Does search/filter work?

4. **Your Intern** (http://localhost:3000/demo/knowledge-base)
   - **CRITICAL**: Are there 4 or 5 tabs? (Expected: Persona, Flow, Database, Scoring, Slots)
   - Does each visible tab load without errors?
   - Does the global AI toggle work?
   - Check console for "Unhandled Promise Rejection" or "React error boundary" messages

5. **Settings** (http://localhost:3000/demo/settings)
   - Does the page load?
   - Is there a Clerk component error in dev mode?

---

**6. COMPLETE LEAD FLOW TEST (CRITICAL)**

Test the end-to-end automation flow that v3.4 delivered:

- **Greeting**: Does a new conversation trigger an AI greeting?
- **Qualification**: Does the AI ask qualifying questions based on Flow config?
- **Routing**: Based on lead score, does the conversation get routed correctly?
- **Booking**: Can the flow reach a booking/handoff state?

Walk through the Inbox with a mock conversation and verify each stage of the flow is represented in the UI. Check that:
- Conversation status reflects the current stage (new -> qualified -> routed -> booked)
- AI responses follow the configured persona/flow settings
- The flow doesn't dead-end or show unexpected states

---

**7. UI POLISH CHECK**

Explicitly check for visual/cosmetic issues across all pages:

- **Spacing**: Are there inconsistent margins/padding between sections or cards?
- **Labels**: Are any labels unclear, truncated, or missing? Check form fields, buttons, tabs.
- **Visual consistency**: Do similar elements look the same across pages? (button styles, card borders, font sizes)
- **Alignment**: Are elements properly aligned within their containers?
- **Empty states**: Do pages handle "no data" gracefully with helpful messages?
- **Responsive**: Does the layout break at different viewport sizes? (Try resizing browser)

List any UI polish issues you notice, even if they seem minor.

---

**Report findings:**
- List any pages that don't load
- List any console errors you see
- List any UI elements that look broken/missing
- Confirm whether Slots tab is visible or missing
- Report complete lead flow test results (which stages work, which don't)
- List any UI polish issues (spacing, labels, visual consistency)
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Report your findings. List issues found or say "all pages working, no issues found".</resume-signal>
</task>
