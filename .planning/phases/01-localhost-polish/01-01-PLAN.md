<objective>
Interactive localhost audit to identify all issues before fixing.

Purpose: The user must manually test /demo pages to discover broken flows, missing UI elements, console errors, and unhandled rejections. This creates the issue list that Plan 02 will fix.
Output: Documented list of issues found during testing (reported verbally via checkpoint).

  <how-to-verify>
**Walk through each /demo page and report issues:**

1. **Dashboard** (http://localhost:3000/demo)
   - Does it load without console errors?
   - Are stats cards showing mock data?
   - Is activity feed visible?

2. **Inbox** (http://localhost:3000/demo/inbox)
   - Does the conversation list load?
   - Can you click on a conversation?
   - Does the status filter dropdown work?
   - Is the AI/Human toggle visible and functional?

3. **Database** (http://localhost:3000/demo/database)
   - Does the contacts table load?
   - Can you view contact details?
   - Does search/filter work?

4. **Your Intern** (http://localhost:3000/demo/knowledge-base)
   - **CRITICAL**: Are there 4 or 5 tabs? (Expected: Persona, Flow, Database, Scoring, Slots)
   - Does each visible tab load without errors?
   - Does the global AI toggle work?
   - Check console for "Unhandled Promise Rejection" or "React error boundary" messages

5. **Settings** (http://localhost:3000/demo/settings)
   - Does the page load?
   - Is there a Clerk component error in dev mode?

**Report findings:**
- List any pages that don't load
- List any console errors you see
- List any UI elements that look broken/missing
- Confirm whether Slots tab is visible or missing
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Report your findings. List issues found or say "all pages working, no issues found".</resume-signal>
