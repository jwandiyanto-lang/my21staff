<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify production deployment health</name>
  <files>N/A (verification only)</files>
  <action>
    Run pre-validation checks to ensure production is ready for testing:

    1. Verify latest code is deployed:
       - Run `git log --oneline -3` to see recent commits
       - Check Vercel deployment status via CLI or note manual check needed

    2. Verify build passes locally:
       - Run `npm run build` to catch any build errors
       - Run `npm run type-check` to verify TypeScript

    3. Create validation checklist for user:
       Generate a clear checklist the user will follow during testing:

       **Landing Page (www.my21staff.com)**
       - [ ] Page loads without errors
       - [ ] Sign in button is visible and clickable
       - [ ] Brand elements display correctly (logo, colors)

       **Authentication Flow**
       - [ ] Clerk sign-in modal opens
       - [ ] Can sign in with email/password or OAuth
       - [ ] No errors during authentication
       - [ ] Redirects to dashboard after sign-in

       **Dashboard Tab**
       - [ ] Page loads without blank screen
       - [ ] Real workspace data displays (not mock data)
       - [ ] No console errors (check browser DevTools)

       **Inbox Tab**
       - [ ] Kapso inbox iframe loads
       - [ ] WhatsApp conversations visible (if any exist)
       - [ ] No loading spinner stuck indefinitely

       **Leads Tab (Database)**
       - [ ] Contact list displays
       - [ ] Can click a contact to see details
       - [ ] Lead panel shows data correctly

       **Your Team Tab**
       - [ ] Page loads without errors
       - [ ] Bot settings visible (Bot Name, Persona, Script)
       - [ ] No Brain tab visible (should be hidden)

    4. Output the checklist for user reference
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Build succeeds: `npm run build` exits with code 0
    - TypeScript passes: `npm run type-check` exits with code 0
    - Checklist printed to console for user
  </verify>
  <done>Pre-validation automated checks pass, user has clear testing checklist</done>
</task>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Production validation checklist and pre-flight checks</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    **Begin manual testing now:**

    1. Open www.my21staff.com in your browser
    2. Open browser DevTools (F12) and keep Console tab visible
    3. Work through the checklist above:
       - Start at landing page
       - Sign in with your account
       - Navigate through each tab: Dashboard, Inbox, Leads, Your Team

    **When you encounter an issue:**
    - Describe the error (what you see, console errors if any)
    - Include screenshot if helpful
    - I will fix immediately and you continue testing

    **Testing complete when:**
    - All checklist items pass without issues
    - OR you've reported and I've fixed all blocking issues
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
    Report any issues you find. Type "all clear" when testing is complete with no issues.

    **Issue format:**
    - **Tab:** [which tab]
    - **Action:** [what you did]
    - **Expected:** [what should happen]
    - **Actual:** [what happened]
    - **Console errors:** [if any]
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

Phase 13 is complete when:
- User can sign in from landing page without errors
- All 4 dashboard tabs load and display real data
- No blocking console errors during normal navigation
- User confirms "all clear" after testing checklist
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Build passes (`npm run build`)
- TypeScript passes (`npm run type-check`)
- User manually verifies all checklist items
- No unresolved blocking issues remain
- Requirements TEST-02 and TEST-03 satisfied
</success_criteria>
