<objective>
Create Convex HTTP endpoint for n8n lead webhook and connect Eagle's Google Sheets workflow.

Purpose: Restore Eagle's lead capture flow that was broken during Supabase -> Convex migration. This is a temporary bridge until Eagle's website connects directly to the CRM.

Output: Working n8n -> Convex lead flow for Eagle Overseas

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create n8n webhook endpoint and mutation</name>
  <files>convex/n8n.ts, convex/http.ts</files>
  <action>
Create convex/n8n.ts with createLead mutation:
- Accept fields: name, phone, email, workspace_id, lead_score, metadata (form_answers)
- Use findOrCreateContact pattern from cms.ts (check by phone, skip if exists)
- If contact exists: return { success: true, status: "exists", contact_id }
- If new contact: create with source="n8n", tags=["google-form"], return { success: true, status: "created", contact_id }
- No auth required (public mutation like findOrCreateContact in cms.ts)

Add HTTP route to convex/http.ts:
- Path: /webhook/n8n
- Method: POST
- Parse JSON body with fields matching eagle-n8n-integration.md:
  - name, phone, email, workspace_id, lead_score, metadata
- Call n8n.createLead mutation
- Return JSON response: { success: boolean, status: "created"|"exists", contact_id }
- Include basic logging for debugging

Phone normalization: Accept +62 or 0 prefix, normalize to consistent format.

Hardcode Eagle workspace ID for now: Use Convex workspaces table lookup by slug "eagle-overseas" to get workspace._id. This avoids exposing workspace IDs in n8n config.

  <name>Task 2: Update n8n workflow URL</name>
  <action>
User must update the n8n workflow to point to the new Convex endpoint.
  </action>
  <instructions>
1. Open n8n at http://100.113.96.25:5678 (via Tailscale)
2. Find the Google Sheets -> Supabase workflow for Eagle
3. Replace the Supabase HTTP Request node with new configuration:
   - URL: https://pleasant-antelope-109.convex.site/webhook/n8n
   - Method: POST
   - Body Content Type: JSON
   - Body Parameters:
     ```json
     {
       "name": "{{ $json['Nama'] }}",
       "phone": "{{ $json['No WhatsApp'] }}",
       "email": "{{ $json['Email'] }}",
       "lead_score": {{ calculated_score }},
       "metadata": {
         "form_answers": {
           "Level Bahasa Inggris": "{{ $json['Level Bahasa Inggris'] }}",
           "Budget": "{{ $json['Budget'] }}",
           "Kapan Mau Berangkat": "{{ $json['Kapan Mau Berangkat'] }}",
           "Aktivitas": "{{ $json['Aktivitas'] }}",
           "Negara Tujuan": "{{ $json['Negara Tujuan'] }}",
           "Remardk": "{{ $json['Remardk'] }}"
         }
       }
     }
     ```
4. Keep the existing score calculation Code node (it works)
5. Save the workflow

  <name>Task 3: Verify lead flow end-to-end</name>
  <what-built>Complete n8n -> Convex lead integration for Eagle Overseas</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Submit a test entry to Eagle's Google Form (or add a row directly to the Google Sheet)
   - Use test data: Name="Test N8N Lead", Phone="+628123456789", Email="test@example.com"
2. Wait for n8n to trigger (check n8n execution history)
3. Check n8n workflow execution succeeded (green checkmark)
4. Open my21staff CRM at https://my21staff.com/eagle-overseas/database
5. Search for "Test N8N Lead" or the phone number
6. Verify:
   - Contact appears in database view
   - Lead score is calculated correctly
   - Metadata contains form_answers
   - Tags include "google-form"
   - Source shows "n8n"
7. Submit same phone number again
8. Verify: No duplicate created (n8n response shows "exists")
