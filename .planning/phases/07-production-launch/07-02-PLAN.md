<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update navigation with sign-in AND Get Started button</name>
  <files>src/components/landing/nav-bar.tsx</files>
  <action>
    1. Read current nav-bar.tsx (currently only has "Login" link)
    2. Update navigation to have BOTH:
       - "Sign In" link to /sign-in (text link, subtle - replaces current "Login")
       - "Get Started" button to /sign-up (primary button, prominent - NEW)
    3. Style "Get Started" as primary CTA:
       - Green background (bg-[#284b31])
       - White text
       - Rounded corners (rounded-lg or rounded-xl)
       - Padding (px-4 py-2)
    4. Style "Sign In" as secondary:
       - Text only, no background
       - Hover underline or color change
       - Keep existing styling pattern
    5. Ensure mobile menu has same links (if mobile menu exists)
    6. Layout: Sign In on left, Get Started button on right (or grouped together on right)
  </action>
  <verify>
    - npm run dev, visit http://localhost:3000
    - Nav shows "Sign In" text link AND "Get Started" button
    - "Sign In" links to /sign-in
    - "Get Started" links to /sign-up
    - "Get Started" is visually prominent (green button)
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Navigation has both Sign In and Get Started
    - Get Started is prominent CTA button linking to /sign-up
    - Sign In is subtle text link to /sign-in
    - Mobile responsive
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Update hero CTA to drive sign-ups</name>
  <files>src/components/landing/hero-section.tsx, src/lib/landing-constants.ts</files>
  <action>
    1. Read hero-section.tsx - currently uses `CTA_TEXT.pricing` which points to "/pricing"
    2. Change hero CTA button href from `CTA_TEXT.pricing` to `/sign-up` directly:
       - Current: `href={CTA_TEXT.pricing}` (which is "/pricing")
       - Change to: `href="/sign-up"`
    3. Keep button text as `CTA_TEXT.primary` ("Start Free Trial") or update to "Get Started"
    4. Optionally add secondary CTA: "See Pricing" -> links to /pricing (if desired)
    5. Verify CTA buttons are prominent and mobile-friendly

    CRITICAL: The href MUST change from CTA_TEXT.pricing to "/sign-up"
  </action>
  <verify>
    - Hero section CTA button links to /sign-up (NOT /pricing)
    - Verify in code: `href="/sign-up"` (not `href={CTA_TEXT.pricing}`)
    - Click button in browser -> navigates to /sign-up page
    - Mobile: button is full-width on small screens or appropriately sized
  </verify>
  <done>
    - Hero CTA href changed from CTA_TEXT.pricing to "/sign-up"
    - Button click navigates to /sign-up
    - Mobile layout confirmed working
  </done>

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Landing page with updated navigation and CTA buttons</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Visit http://localhost:3000 (dev server)
    2. Check navigation:
       - Is "Sign In" visible and subtle?
       - Is "Get Started" button prominent (green)?
       - Does "Sign In" link to /sign-in?
       - Does "Get Started" link to /sign-up?
    3. Check hero section:
       - Is the headline compelling?
       - Is the CTA button clear?
       - Does it link to /sign-up (NOT /pricing)?
    4. Check mobile view:
       - Resize browser to mobile width
       - Is navigation usable?
       - Is hero readable?
    5. Provide feedback:
       - What changes would improve first impressions?
       - Any copy/text improvements?
       - Any styling tweaks needed?
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
