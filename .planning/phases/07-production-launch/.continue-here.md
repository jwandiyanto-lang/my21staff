<current_state>
Phase 7-03 (authentication verification) is at a checkpoint waiting for user to test auth flow.

However, user is actively iterating on landing page design (part of 07-02 refinement).

**Landing page iteration in progress:**
- Hero section has gone through 8+ iterations
- Just added features section below hero
- User wants exact Figma reference layout match
- Features section needs redesign to match reference screenshot

**Auth checkpoint status:**
- Tasks 1-2 complete (auth pages configured, Clerk-Convex verified)
- Task 3 waiting: User needs to test sign-up/sign-in flow at www.my21staff.com
- Task 4 pending: Document production state after verification
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**07-01: Production Deployment (COMPLETE)**
- Deployed to www.my21staff.com
- Fixed 6 TypeScript/build errors
- Clerk auth active in production
- Environment variables configured (DEV_MODE=false)

**07-02: Landing Page Polish (COMPLETE with ongoing refinement)**
- Navigation: Sign In link + Get Started button
- Hero section: Multiple iterations
  - Final copy: "Stop Drowning in WhatsApp. Start Closing Deals."
  - Subheadline: "Your AI Sales Team in a Box. AI handles the routine. You handle the complex."
  - CTA: "Chat With Us Now!" → https://wa.me/message/WMW65Q7UGTDNE1
  - Activity feed mockup on right side
- Features section added below hero (needs redesign)

**07-03: Auth Verification (IN PROGRESS)**
- Task 1: Auth pages configured ✅
- Task 2: Clerk-Convex integration verified ✅
- Task 3: Checkpoint - waiting for user to test ⏸️
- Task 4: Document production state (not started)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Immediate (landing page):**
1. Redesign features section to match Figma reference exactly:
   - Layout: 2 columns (features left, CRM screenshot right)
   - Left: Heading + 3 features stacked vertically
   - Feature 1: Detailed with icon + title + description
   - Features 2 & 3: Brief (icon + title + short description)
   - Yellow quotation marks in bottom-left
   - Right: CRM screenshot in browser mockup (digitalized/polished)
   - Reduce white space, tighter spacing
   - Use business brand guidelines fonts
   - Clean, minimal, professional styling

**Then (authentication):**
2. User tests auth flow at www.my21staff.com:
   - Sign-up at /sign-up
   - Sign-in at /sign-in
   - Dashboard access at /demo
   - Verify no errors

3. Document production state in STATE.md

4. Complete 07-03 plan and create SUMMARY.md
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

**Landing page iterations:**
- Removed Indonesian copy → English only (target market shift)
- Removed "View Demo" button → Single "Chat With Us Now!" CTA
- CTA links to WhatsApp (https://wa.me/message/WMW65Q7UGTDNE1) not /sign-up
- Activity feed mockup instead of WhatsApp chat phone mockup (cleaner)
- Features section layout must match Figma reference (user provided screenshot)

**Design constraints:**
- No colored gradient icons (user feedback: "just the black")
- Clean white background, minimal look
- Match business brand guidelines (professional, minimal)
- Shorter copy everywhere (user: "words need to be shorter")
- CRM screenshot needs "digitalized" look (browser frame, not raw screenshot)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>

**User design iteration:**
- User keeps refining landing page design
- Each iteration requires agent resume with new feedback
- Multiple tool rejections (user interrupting to give clearer direction)

**Pattern observed:**
User has clear vision but communicating it incrementally through screenshots and feedback rounds. Best approach: Get exact Figma reference, implement precisely, minimize back-and-forth.
</blockers>

<context>

**What's happening:**
This is Phase 7 (Production Launch). The phase has 3 main plans:
1. 07-01: Deploy infrastructure ✅ DONE
2. 07-02: Landing page polish ✅ DONE (but user iterating on design)
3. 07-03: Auth verification ⏸️ PAUSED AT CHECKPOINT

**Why we're here:**
User is perfecting the landing page before testing auth. Makes sense - landing page is first impression, needs to be right.

**The vibe:**
User knows exactly what they want visually (has Figma reference). They're providing screenshots and iterative feedback. Agent keeps trying to infer requirements but user prefers to correct as we go.

**Strategy moving forward:**
1. Finish landing page features section (match Figma exactly)
2. Get user approval on landing page
3. Then proceed to auth testing (resume 07-03 checkpoint)
4. Complete Phase 7, verify with gsd-verifier
5. Move to Phase 8 (Testing & Polish)

**Files to watch:**
- `src/components/landing/hero-section.tsx` - Hero iterations
- `src/components/landing/features-section.tsx` - New section being designed
- `.planning/phases/07-production-launch/07-03-SUMMARY.md` - Needs to be created after checkpoint completes

**Agent state:**
- Agent a2f40d5 is paused at checkpoint
- Can resume with: `resume="a2f40d5"` in Task tool
- Agent has full context of all iterations
</context>

<next_action>

**Option A: Continue landing page refinement**
Resume agent a2f40d5 with exact Figma layout requirements:
- 2-column grid (features left, screenshot right)
- Features: heading + 3 stacked (1 detailed, 2 brief)
- Yellow quotation marks bottom-left
- CRM screenshot digitalized (browser frame, 3D tilt)
- Tight spacing, clean minimal styling

**Option B: Finish auth testing first**
User tests www.my21staff.com auth flow, reports results, complete 07-03, then return to landing page polish.

**Recommended:** Option A (user is focused on landing page design right now)

**First command:**
```
Resume agent a2f40d5 with user's exact Figma layout requirements.
```
