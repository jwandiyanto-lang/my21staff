# Plan Summary: 04-02 Human Verification Checkpoint

## Status: DEFERRED

Human verification deferred to consolidated deployment verification (combined with Phases 1-4).

## Reason for Deferral

User requested consolidating all verification into a single session after deployment rather than testing each phase individually. This allows:
- Single deployment to production
- Comprehensive testing of all features together
- More efficient use of testing time

## What Needs Verification

See `.planning/phases/04-settings/VERIFICATION-CHECKLIST.md` for consolidated checklist covering Phases 1-4.

## Commits

No code commits (verification checkpoint only).

## Next Steps

1. Deploy to production
2. Run consolidated verification checklist
3. Report any issues for gap closure in Phase 5
