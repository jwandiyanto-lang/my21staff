<objective>
Create foundation for landing page redesign - component folder structure and shared constants.

Purpose: Establish infrastructure that Plan 02 (Hero + Features) and Plan 03 (CTA + Integration) depend on.
Output: Component export barrel + constants file with WhatsApp link and feature data.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create landing components folder with export barrel</name>
  <files>src/components/landing/index.ts</files>
  <action>
Create the landing components directory structure:
- Create `src/components/landing/` directory
- Create `index.ts` as export barrel

The index.ts should be prepared to re-export components that will be created in Plan 02:
```typescript
// Landing page components
// Components will be added as they are created

export {}  // Placeholder to make this a valid module
```

This establishes the folder structure. Components will be added by subsequent plans.
  </action>
  <verify>File exists at src/components/landing/index.ts</verify>
  <done>Landing components folder created with index.ts barrel file</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create landing constants with WhatsApp link and feature data</name>
  <files>src/lib/landing-constants.ts</files>
  <action>
Create constants file for landing page with:

1. WhatsApp click-to-chat link:
   - Use my21staff WhatsApp number (placeholder: 6281234567890)
   - Pre-filled message in English: "Hi, I'd like to learn more about my21staff"
   - Format: `https://wa.me/{number}?text={encoded_message}`

2. Features array for features grid (based on CONTEXT.md - features-focused content):
   - Structure: `{ icon: string, title: string, description: string }`
   - Icon should be Lucide icon name (string, resolved at component level)
   - English language per CONTEXT.md

   Features to include (derived from existing landing page value props):
   - WhatsApp Automation: "24/7 response, auto follow-up, lead scoring"
   - Lead Management: "Track every conversation, never miss a hot lead"
   - Data-Driven Insights: "Weekly reports, conversion tracking, clear metrics"
   - Your CRM, Your Way: "Grows with your business, built around your process"

Type definitions:
```typescript
export interface Feature {
  icon: string  // Lucide icon name
  title: string
  description: string
}
```

Export:
- WHATSAPP_NUMBER: string
- WHATSAPP_MESSAGE: string (encoded)
- WHATSAPP_LINK: string (full URL)
- FEATURES: Feature[]
  </action>
  <verify>
TypeScript compiles without errors:
```bash
npx tsc src/lib/landing-constants.ts --noEmit
```
  </verify>
  <done>Constants file exports WHATSAPP_LINK and FEATURES array with 4 features</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
- [ ] `src/components/landing/` directory exists
- [ ] `src/components/landing/index.ts` exists and is valid TypeScript
- [ ] `src/lib/landing-constants.ts` exports WHATSAPP_LINK, WHATSAPP_NUMBER, FEATURES
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Landing components folder structure established
- WhatsApp click-to-chat link ready for use
- Feature data typed and available for features grid component
- Foundation ready for Plan 02 and Plan 03
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/07-landing-page-redesign/07-01-SUMMARY.md`
