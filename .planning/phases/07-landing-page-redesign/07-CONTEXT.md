# Phase 7: Landing Page Redesign - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-19
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Convert visitors to WhatsApp leads through a mobile-optimized landing page. English language for international market. Features-focused content to create curiosity. Social proof lives on pricing page.

## Implementation Decisions

### Language & Market
- English language (not Bahasa Indonesia)
- Indonesian market will have a separate landing page later
- Keep existing messaging/value props from current page

### Hero Section
- Headline: "24/7 Digital Workforce"
- Supporting message: WhatsApp automation as the hidden gem
- Secondary message: CRM/database that grows with them (not overwhelming like typical CRMs)
- Layout: User will provide code — use as reference

### Content Structure
- Features-focused (creates curiosity, "yes another software... but different" vibe)
- Social proof (testimonials, logos) lives on pricing page, NOT on landing
- Minimalist cards for feature presentation — clean icons + short text, let simplicity speak

### Design Direction
- Adapt HTML reference design to fit brand guidelines
- **Colors:** Brand plan (sage + orange) — NOT forest green CRM theme
  - Background: #FBFBFA (off-white)
  - Hero section: #B6C9BB (sage green)
  - CTA buttons: #F7931A (orange)
  - Body text: #37352F (dark)
- **Typography:** Plus Jakarta Sans (headlines) + Inter (body)
- **Logo:** Consistent my21staff wordmark usage throughout — uniform everywhere

### Images
- Source from Unsplash or provide AI prompts for generation
- Real pictures, natural uplifting AI/business images
- Iterate together — Claude proposes, user approves/adjusts

### Mobile Layout
- Claude's discretion based on research and best practices:
  - Hero section behavior (stack, text-only, or full-screen)
  - Feature cards display (single column, carousel, etc.)
  - Sticky CTA presence/placement
  - Navigation style (hamburger, minimal header, etc.)

### Claude's Discretion
- Mobile responsiveness approach
- Section spacing and rhythm
- Animation/micro-interactions (if any)
- Exact card layout and icon choices
- Image selection from Unsplash

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Reference HTML shared by user: Forest green sidebar + orange accents dashboard mockup
  - Use this design language but adapt colors to brand guidelines (sage, not forest green)
- rams.ai referenced for minimalist, technical aesthetic — extract the "clean" and "no-fluff" feel
- "Another software but different" — landing should intrigue, not overwhelm

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- CRM redesign with new design language — separate phase (user shared HTML reference)
- Indonesian language landing page — separate page/phase
- Social proof section — lives on pricing page per user decision

</deferred>
