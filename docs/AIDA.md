|---------|------------------------|
| Leads everywhere | No system to capture them |
| Forgot to follow up | No system to remind you |
| Proposals scattered | No system to organize them |
| Can't see pipeline | No system to track it |
| Stuck at ceiling | No system to scale |

**Symptom: Leads Everywhere**
> "Leads from WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, ads — scattered everywhere."

**The System:**
- WhatsApp Messaging — All conversations in one place
- Lead Reminders — Never forget to follow up (even from Twitter DMs)
- Unified Inbox — Every lead, every channel, one dashboard

**Skill:** `Lead Management` — AI tracks, reminds, follows up automatically.

**Skill:** `Proposal Manager` — "Send proposal for Project X" → Bot finds it, sends it, logs it.
