# Business Plan — my21staff

**No system, no growth.**

**Version:** 1.2
**Date:** 2026-01-15

## Executive Summary

**Core Truth:** No system, no growth.

Indonesian SMEs have leads coming in — but no system to capture them. Without a system, they can't scale.

**my21staff is the system.** AI handles the routine — follow-ups, reminders, reports. Humans handle the complex — strategy, troubleshooting, decisions. One dashboard, one team, finally scale.

**Target Market:** Indonesia's 60M+ SMEs, starting with service businesses using digital marketing.

**Business Model:** SaaS subscription (Rp2.5-10M/month) + one-time setup fees.

**Differentiator:** AI handles the routine. Humans handle the complex. That's why it works.

**CTA:** Get the system. Start growing.

## Problem

Indonesian SMEs have leads coming in — but no system to manage them:

| Problem | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Leads scattered across channels | Can't see the full picture |
| Manual tracking everywhere | Screenshot chats, save numbers by hand |
| No follow-up system | Hot leads go cold |
| No pipeline visibility | Can't forecast, can't plan |
| Everything is manual | Can't scale |

**The Core Issue:** Without a system, you can't scale. Most Indonesian SMEs hit a growth ceiling because they're stuck doing everything manually.

**Current Solutions Fail:**
- Excel/Google Sheets: Manual entry, no execution
- Global CRMs (HubSpot, Salesforce): Too complex, too expensive
- Chatbots: Respond to customers, but don't execute operations
- Competitors (SleekFlow): Self-service only, no execution support
