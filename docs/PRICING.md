## Pricing Philosophy

### UMR Anchor

Our Team tier (Rp5.5jt) is intentionally priced around Indonesia's Upah Minimum Regional (minimum wage). This creates a clear comparison:

> "An AI team for the price of one entry-level employee."

### No Per-Contact Pricing

Unlike competitors who charge per contact or message volume, we offer flat monthly pricing. Grow without worrying about usage limits.

### AI + Human Included

The hybrid model is included in every plan — not an upsell. AI executes routine tasks. Humans step in for complex decisions. This is our core differentiator.

| Mid | Rp5.5jt (~$340) | $149-199/mo | AI team vs DIY automation |
| High | Rp10jt (~$620) | $349-399/mo | Full execution vs self-service |

## WhatsApp Messaging Quota

Each subscription includes a monthly WhatsApp marketing message quota. Service messages (customer-initiated) are always FREE.

### Included Quota

| Plan | Monthly Marketing Messages | Overage Rate |
|------|---------------------------|--------------|
| **Solo** | 500 | Rp500/msg |
| **Team** | 1,500 | Rp400/msg |
| **Studio** | 5,000 | Rp300/msg |

### Message Types

| Type | Description | Cost |
|------|-------------|------|
| **Service** | Customer messages you first (within 24hr window) | FREE |
| **Utility** | Order updates, receipts, shipping notifications | FREE |
| **Marketing** | Broadcasts, promos, announcements, cold outreach | Counted toward quota |

### How It Works

1. **Within quota**: No extra charge
2. **Over quota**: Charged per message at overage rate
3. **Reset**: Quota resets monthly on billing date
4. **Tracking**: View usage in dashboard (coming soon)

### Example

| Scenario | Messages Sent | Quota | Overage | Extra Cost |
|----------|---------------|-------|---------|------------|
| Solo user sends 400 marketing | 400 | 500 | 0 | Rp0 |
| Solo user sends 800 marketing | 800 | 500 | 300 | Rp150,000 |
| Team user sends 2,000 marketing | 2,000 | 1,500 | 500 | Rp200,000 |

**Tip:** Optimize for inbound! Customer-initiated conversations are FREE and don't count toward quota.
