# Phase 4.1 Plan 02: Inbox Filters Summary

**Inbox status filters reverted to v2.0 popover with checkboxes, replacing chip/badge style**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 5 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-25T05:00:53Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25T05:06:00Z
- **Tasks:** 5
- **Files modified:** 2
- **Files deleted:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Status filter popover with checkboxes matching v2.0 design
- Filter badge showing count of active filters
- Clear all button for quick filter reset
- Simplified ConversationList to display-only component
- Removed unused filter-chips component

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add popover imports** - `5f2c096` (feat)
2. **Task 2 & 3: Add status filter popover with checkboxes** - `bb4acc2` (feat)
3. **Task 4: Simplify ConversationList** - `ec2b98b` (feat)
4. **Task 5: Remove filter-chips component** - `71eddb9` (chore)

## Files Modified
- `src/app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/inbox/inbox-client.tsx` - Added filter header with popover
- `src/components/inbox/conversation-list.tsx` - Simplified to display-only

## Files Deleted
- `src/components/inbox/filter-chips.tsx` - No longer needed with popover style

## Decisions Made
- Combined Tasks 2 & 3 into single commit - both related to popover implementation
- Removed tag filters from UI - v2.0 design only had status filters
- Kept tagFilters in Convex query - maintains backend flexibility

## Deviations from Plan
None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
- Build lock file collision - resolved by cleaning .next directory

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Inbox filters restored to v2.0 style
- Ready for Plan 03 (Contact Detail Sheet) or Plan 04 (Database view)
