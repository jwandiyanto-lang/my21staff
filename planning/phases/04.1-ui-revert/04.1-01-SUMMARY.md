# Phase 04.1 Plan 01: Contact Detail Sheet Revert Summary

**Reverted contact detail from 4-tab to 3-tab v2.0 style (Details, Messages, Activity) while preserving Convex backend**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-25T05:01:02Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-25T05:04:53Z
- **Tasks:** 3 (consolidated into 1 commit)
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments
- Renamed profile tab to details, notes tab to activity
- Removed documents tab entirely (was placeholder)
- Added messages tab with placeholder text for Plan 03 inbox connection
- Updated component documentation comment

## Task Commits

All tasks committed atomically (consolidated due to single file):

1. **Task 1-3: Revert to 3-tab v2.0 style** - `f485c91` (feat)
   - Task 1: Sheet already in place (no changes needed)
   - Task 2: Changed TabsContent values to match 3-tab structure
   - Task 3: Updated messages tab placeholder text

## Files Modified
- `src/app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/database/contact-detail-sheet.tsx` - Contact detail sheet with 3-tab interface

## Decisions Made
- **Sheet component already present:** The file already used Sheet (not Dialog), so Task 1 required no code changes
- **Consolidated commit:** All 3 tasks modified the same file with tightly coupled changes, committed as single atomic unit

## Deviations from Plan

### Observations

**1. Task 1 already complete in codebase**
- **Found during:** Initial file inspection
- **Issue:** Plan expected Dialog component, but file already uses Sheet
- **Action:** No changes needed for Task 1, proceeded with Tasks 2-3
- **Impact:** None - faster execution

---

**Total deviations:** 0 (Task 1 was already done, not a deviation)
**Impact on plan:** Plan executed successfully, just faster than expected

## Issues Encountered
- Next.js 16 Turbopack build had intermittent race condition (known issue), TypeScript check passed successfully

## Next Phase Readiness
- Contact detail sheet ready with 3-tab structure
- Messages tab placeholder awaits Plan 03 (inbox connection)
- Activity tab functional with notes
