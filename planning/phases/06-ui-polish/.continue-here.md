<current_state>
Interactive UI polish session paused. User testing localhost:3000/demo and reporting visual/UX issues one by one. Claude fixes immediately.

**Current page:** Inbox (/demo/inbox)
**Last interaction:** Fixed InfoSidebar header with name + editable status badge, added Lead Background section, fixed Notes overlay to cover full sidebar.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**Dashboard:**
- Synced mock stats with Database (5 contacts)
- Disabled Quick Actions section

**Inbox - Conversation List:**
- Cleaner layout: Name + Timestamp (row 1), Message preview (row 2), Status tag (row 3)
- Avatar uses status color as background
- Filters work: search, status, tags, active/all toggle

**Inbox - Message Thread:**
- Messages have max-width container (max-w-3xl mx-auto)
- Better readability, bubbles don't stretch to edges

**InfoSidebar - Header:**
- Shows contact name + editable status badge
- Status badge is clickable dropdown to change status
- Removed separate "LEAD STATUS" section (moved to header)

**InfoSidebar - Lead Background:**
- New section showing form Q&A (5 questions max)
- Shows: Pendidikan, Jurusan, Negara Tujuan, Budget, Target Berangkat
- Displayed after Contact Info, before Score

**InfoSidebar - Quick Actions:**
- Removed "View Conversation" button
- "Merge" opens two-step dialog (select contact → compare fields side by side)
- "Note" toggles full-page amber overlay

**InfoSidebar - Notes Panel:**
- Full overlay covers ENTIRE sidebar (inset-0, not top-[108px])
- Amber/cream color scheme to stand out
- Scrollable notes list
- Chat-bar style input with due date toggle (clock button)
- Calendar inline when due date picker active

**Mock Data Updated:**
- form_answers added to MOCK_CONTACTS metadata
- Budi: S1 IT, Australia, 300jt, 2026
- Siti: SMA Business, Malaysia, 150jt, 2027
- MOCK_NOTES added for both contacts
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**Known issues (not yet fixed):**
- User has not reported any more issues this session

**Potential areas to test:**
- Settings page (/demo/settings)
- Database page (/demo/database)
- Dashboard page (/demo)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Dark mode consistency
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **Interactive approach:** User describes issues one-by-one, Claude fixes immediately
- **Dev mode pattern:** Components check `isDevMode()` and skip Clerk/Convex calls
- **Status in header:** Editable badge beside contact name (more compact)
- **Lead Background:** Shows form Q&A that contributed to the lead score
- **Notes full overlay:** inset-0 covers entire sidebar including bottom
- **Conversation list layout:** 3-row design (name+time, message, status)
- **Merge two-step:** Select contact → Compare fields side by side
</decisions_made>
