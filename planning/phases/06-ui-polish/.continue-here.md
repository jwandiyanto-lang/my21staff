<current_state>
Interactive UI polish session. User describes issues one-by-one, Claude fixes them immediately.

Currently working on localhost:3000/demo — testing Dashboard, Inbox, Database pages.

Most recent: Fixed InfoSidebar — removed duplicate name, added close button, made it overlay chat.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

**Dashboard:**
- Synced mock stats with Database (5 contacts, 2 hot, 1 warm, 1 new, 1 cold)
- Disabled Quick Actions section (commented out)

**Inbox:**
- Added dev mode support (skips Convex, uses mock data)
- Synced mock contacts with Database API (Budi Santoso, Siti Rahayu)
- Created mock conversations and messages for both contacts
- ComposeInput split into dev/prod versions (bypasses Clerk in dev mode)
- MessageThread uses mock messages in dev mode
- InfoSidebar toggle button added beside "ARI Active" in header
- InfoSidebar now overlays on top of chat (position: absolute)
- InfoSidebar has close button in header
- Removed duplicate name/avatar from sidebar (cleaner header)

**Mock Data Sync:**
- `MOCK_CONTACTS` in mock-data.ts synced with `/api/contacts` mock data
- `MOCK_CONVERSATIONS` uses contact-001 (Budi) and contact-002 (Siti)
- `MOCK_MESSAGES` has realistic conversation content for both
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

**User to test and report:**
- Continue testing localhost:3000/demo pages
- User describes next issue → Claude fixes it
- Repeat until all UI polish items resolved

**Potential areas (from roadmap success criteria):**
1. No console errors or component crashes in dev mode
2. Pages load instantly with proper loading states
3. Smooth transitions and consistent hover states
4. Navigation feels natural (sidebar, back button, page transitions)
5. All core pages work: Dashboard, Inbox, Database, Settings
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- **Interactive approach:** User describes issues one-by-one rather than formal planning
- **Dev mode pattern:** Components check `isDevMode()` and skip Clerk/Convex calls
- **Mock data consolidation:** All mock data should match between services
- **Sidebar overlay:** InfoSidebar overlays chat instead of pushing (absolute positioning)
- **Toggle placement:** Sidebar toggle beside "ARI Active" button in message header
- **Sidebar header:** Simple "Contact Info" title + close button (no duplicate name/avatar)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — all changes compile and work in dev mode
</blockers>

<context>
This is an informal "polish" phase where the user tests the app and reports visual/UX issues.
The approach is iterative and fast — no formal plans needed, just quick fixes.

Key files modified:
- `src/app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/dashboard-client.tsx` — mock stats
- `src/app/(dashboard)/[workspace]/inbox/inbox-client.tsx` — dev mode, sidebar toggle
- `src/components/inbox/compose-input.tsx` — dev/prod split for Clerk
- `src/components/inbox/message-thread.tsx` — dev mode, toggle button
- `src/components/contact/info-sidebar.tsx` — close button, cleaner header
- `src/lib/mock-data.ts` — consolidated mock contacts/conversations/messages
</context>

<next_action>
Resume with: "What's the next UI issue you see?"

User should be testing localhost:3000/demo and reporting issues one by one.
</next_action>
