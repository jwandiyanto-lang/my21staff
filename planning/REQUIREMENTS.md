## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Complete Kapso Inbox replacement | Using Kapso as UI pattern reference, not wholesale replacement |
| WhatsApp Flows (multi-step forms) | Requires Meta approval, complex setup |
| Voice agent integration | Significant complexity, defer to v4.0+ |
| Multi-user chat assignment | Single workspace user model for now |
| Custom bot training UI | Persona/Flow tabs provide sufficient control |
